# Fully Dynamic Conversation Implementation - Changelog

## Major Changes

1. **Completely Revised Conversation Flow**
   - Replaced the static, stage-based conversation with a fully dynamic approach
   - LLM now directly responds to user input without following a predefined script
   - Conversation feels natural rather than like a structured form

2. **Enhanced LLM Integration**
   - Enabled actual API calls to OpenRouter instead of using static responses
   - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Implemented JSON parsing for structured data extraction

3. **Intelligent Project Information Extraction**
   - Added automatic extraction of project details from conversation
   - System builds up project state organically through natural dialogue
   - No more rigid question-answer format

4. **New Dynamic Conversation Script**
   - Added `dynamic_conversation.py` for a CLI interface to the new system
   - Updated documentation to explain the new approach

## How to Test

1. Set up your OpenRouter API key:

   ```bash
   ./dynamic_conversation.py
   ```

3. Have a natural conversation with the agent about your project
