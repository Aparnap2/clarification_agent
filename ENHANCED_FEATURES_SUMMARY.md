## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Activity Logging System
```python
# Beautiful, type-safe activity logging
with ActivityContext(
    logger,
    ActivityType.SEARCH,
    "🔍 Web Search: Python frameworks",
    "Searching for latest information"
) as activity:
    results = await search_tool.search_web(query)
    activity.update(f"Found {len(results)} results")
    # Automatic completion with timing
```

### Enhanced Web Search
```python
# Comprehensive search with activity logging
async def search_web(self, query, engine="duckduckgo"):
    with ActivityContext(...) as search_activity:
        # Browser configuration
        browser_conf = BrowserConfig(headless=True)
        
        # Individual page crawling with sub-activities
        for url in urls:
            with ActivityContext(...) as crawler_activity:
                result = await crawler.arun(url)
                # Extract and log content
```

### Smart Search Detection
```python
# Automatic search triggering
SEARCH_TRIGGERS = [
    "latest", "current", "recent", "best practices",
    "what is", "how to", "compare", "vs", "tutorials"
]

if any(trigger in user_input.lower() for trigger in SEARCH_TRIGGERS):
