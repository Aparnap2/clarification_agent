# Implementation Notes: Clarification Agent

This document provides an overview of the implementation of the Clarification Agent, a conversational AI tool that helps users clarify and plan their projects.

## Architecture Overview

The Clarification Agent uses a conversation-driven approach with multiple AI perspectives to help users clarify their project requirements. The key components are:

1. **Conversation Agent**: The core component that manages the staged conversation flow
2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Different agent roles (Product Manager, Tech Lead, etc.) that provide specialized insights
3. **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter integration for AI-powered suggestions and responses
4. **Output Generation**: Automatic generation of project documentation and planning files

## Key Files

- `clarification_agent/core/conversation_agent.py`: The main conversation agent implementation
- `clarification_agent/utils/llm_helper.py`: LLM integration for AI-powered suggestions
- `app_conversation.py`: Streamlit web interface for the conversation agent
- `cli_conversation.py`: Command-line interface for the conversation agent

## Conversation Flow

The conversation follows a staged flow with these steps:

1. **Project Description**: User describes their project
2. **Product Manager Perspective**: Clarify core features and user needs
3. **Scope Reduction**: Identify what to exclude from the MVP
4. **Business Analysis**: Understand target users and market fit
5. **Technology Selection**: Choose appropriate tech stack
6. **Technical Architecture**: Discuss technical requirements and constraints
7. **File Structure**: Plan the project's file organization
8. **UX Considerations**: Identify key user journeys and workflows
9. **Task Planning**: Break down the project into actionable tasks
10. **Quality Assurance**: Identify critical functionality and edge cases
11. **Summary**: Generate project documentation and planning files

Each stage extracts specific information from the user's responses to build a comprehensive project plan.

## Multi-Perspective Approach

The agent takes on different roles during the conversation:

- **Product Manager**: Focuses on user needs and product features
- **Tech Lead**: Evaluates technical feasibility and architecture
- **Business Analyst**: Considers business value and market fit
- **UX Designer**: Ensures good user experience and interface
- **QA Engineer**: Identifies potential issues and edge cases

This approach ensures that the project is considered from multiple angles, leading to more comprehensive planning.

## Output Files

The agent generates several files to document the project:

1. **README.md**: Project overview, features, and tech stack
2. **.plan.yml**: Structured task list with estimates and priorities
3. **architecture.md**: Technical decisions and file structure
4. **.clarity/*.json**: Project data in structured JSON format

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Real LLM Integration**: Replace simulated responses with actual OpenRouter API calls
2. **Memory Persistence**: Improve conversation memory and context handling
3. **Graph Visualization**: Add Neo4j integration for visualizing project decisions
4. **Code Generation**: Add initial code scaffolding based on the project plan
5. **Integration with Development Tools**: Connect with IDEs and project management tools
