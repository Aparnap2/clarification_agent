Here’s a comprehensive **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for your **Clarification Agent** leveraging LangGraph, Python, Streamlit, ccrawl4ai, and OpenRouter. This PRD covers the purpose, features, architecture, and workflow—integrating best practices from the LangGraph ecosystem.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Clarification Agent

### 1. **Purpose**
Build an AI-powered agent that clarifies ambiguous user queries, gathers missing information, and provides actionable, context-aware responses. The agent should support interactive clarification, web search, and persistent conversation state, accessible via a Streamlit UI.

### 2. **Core Features**

- **Multi-Turn Clarification Dialog:**  
  The agent asks follow-up questions when user input is unclear, iteratively refining the user’s intent.

- **Document & Web Search Integration:**  
  Automatically retrieves and summarizes relevant information from local docs (via ccrawl4ai) and the web (via OpenRouter or other LLMs/tools).

- **Stateful Conversation Management:**  
  Maintains full conversation history and context using LangGraph’s state object, enabling coherent multi-step interactions.

- **Tool-Calling & Conditional Routing:**  
  Dynamically decides whether to clarify, search, or answer, using conditional edges and tool nodes in the LangGraph graph[2][3].

- **Streamlit Frontend:**  
  Provides a user-friendly chat interface for real-time interaction and visualizes the agent’s reasoning steps.

- **Extensible Node Architecture:**  
  Easily add or modify nodes for new tools, APIs, or business logic.

### 3. **Architecture & Workflow**

#### **High-Level Flow**

1. **User submits a query** via Streamlit.
2. **Clarification Node** analyzes input:
   - If ambiguous, asks a clarifying question.
   - If clear, proceeds to answer or search.
3. **Search Node** (if needed):
   - Uses ccrawl4ai for local docs or OpenRouter for web search.
   - Summarizes and returns relevant info.
4. **Answer Node** generates a final response.
5. **Conversation State** is updated and displayed.
6. **Loop**: If more clarification is needed, the agent continues the dialog.

#### **LangGraph Implementation**

- **State Object**:  
  ```python
  class State(TypedDict):
      messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
      context: dict  # for storing clarification status, search results, etc.
  ```

- **Nodes**:
  - **Clarification Node**: Determines if the query needs clarification.
  - **Search Node**: Integrates ccrawl4ai/OpenRouter for retrieval.
  - **Answer Node**: Uses LLM to generate responses.
  - **Tool Nodes**: For any additional APIs or actions.

- **Edges**:
  - **Conditional Edges**: Route flow based on node outputs (e.g., clarify vs. search vs. answer)[2][3].
  - **Loopbacks**: Allow multiple rounds of clarification.

#### **Example Node/Edge Setup**
```python
graph_builder.add_node("clarification", clarification_node)
graph_builder.add_node("search", search_node)
graph_builder.add_node("answer", answer_node)

graph_builder.add_edge(START, "clarification")
graph_builder.add_conditional_edge(
    "clarification", clarification_condition, {
        "clarify": "clarification",
        "search": "search",
        "answer": "answer"
    }
)
graph_builder.add_edge("search", "answer")
graph_builder.add_edge("answer", END)
```
- `clarification_condition` is a function that decides the next step based on the state.

### 4. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features**

- Streamlit chat UI
- Clarification node (LLM-based)
- Search node (ccrawl4ai + OpenRouter)
- Answer node (LLM-based)
- Persistent conversation state
- Conditional routing between nodes
- Logging and error handling

### 5. **Future/Advanced Features**

- User authentication
- Saving and exporting chat sessions
- Analytics dashboard for query types and clarification rates
- Plug-and-play for additional tools/APIs

### 6. **Success Criteria**

- Agent consistently clarifies ambiguous queries.
- Users receive accurate, context-aware answers.
- Seamless multi-turn interaction with stateful memory.
- Responsive, intuitive Streamlit interface.
